1. Download the triangular mesh of the CT femur bone from:
   https://jh.app.box.com/s/n1vhute9sbxjkr5oowu60r13jldxrs5b

2. Import the mesh using the V-REP tutorial:
   http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/importExport.htm

3. Make sure the mesh is cuttable by:
   -In the "Scene Hierarchy" tab, double click on the shape icon (looks like a pear) next to the name 
    of the imported mesh
   -Change to the "Common" section of the "Scene Object Properties" dialogue box that just appeared
   -Under "Object special properties", select the "Cuttable" check mark
   
4. Now the mesh can be moved into position for milling. Here is a simple tutorial for moving objects:
